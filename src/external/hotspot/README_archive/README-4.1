HotSpot 4.1 Changes
-------------------
This release of HotSpot incorporates the following improvements:

1) The steady-state solver of the grid model has been upgraded from
a Gauss-Seidel solver to a multigrid solver. This results in typical
steady-state computation speedups > 20x. In order to facilitate the
multigrid implementation, now the grid dimensions are required to be
a power of two. Hence, the default grid size has been modified from 
50x50 to 64x64. 

2) The simulator template (sim-template.c) that illustrates the use 
of HotSpot in a typical cycle-accurate simulator has been upgraded 
to include grid model usage. Earlier it only demonstrated the use of 
the block model (sim-template_block.c)

3) The 'Makefile' has been upgraded to wrap HotSpot into a library 
(libhotspot.a) for easier integration with existing simulators.

4) Bugfixes etc.:
	a) A bug in 'hotspot.c' lead to erroneous power averaging in
	modeling 3-D chips while using the grid model. This has been
	fixed in this release.
	b) A bug in the floorplan plotting script 'tofig.pl' caused
	temporary files not to be deleted. It has been fixed now.
	c) Other minor changes like fixing typos etc.
