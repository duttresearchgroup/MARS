HotSpot 4.2 Changes
-------------------
This release of HotSpot incorporates the following improvements:

1) An MS Excel 2003 interface to HotSpot ("hotspotUI.xls") that lets 
users input the floorplan and power trace values through an Excel 
spreadsheet. The HotSpot simulator can then be run from the 
spreadsheet itself. The floorplan and the steady-state thermal map 
are displayed within Excel. The temperature trace numbers are also 
output to the Excel spreadsheet.

2) Compilation support under Windows/VC++ through a new "Makefile.VC"
file

3) Other minor changes like support for higher number of functional
blocks, improved printing of floorplan statistics etc.
