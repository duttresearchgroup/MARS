*
* @section intro Introduction
* Adaptive, or self-aware, computing has been proposed as one method to help application programmers confront the growing complexity of multicore software development.
*
* However, existing approaches to adaptive systems are largely ad hoc and often do not manage to incorporate the true performance goals of the applications they are designed to support.
*
* This project proposed an enabling technology for adaptive computing systems: Application Heartbeats. The Application Heartbeats framework provides a simple, standard programming interface that applications can use to indicate their performance and system software (and hardware) can use to query an application's performance.
